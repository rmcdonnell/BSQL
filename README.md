# BSQL
Me taking a stab at making a python version of SQL on my own. The purpose is to get a better understanding of SQL and some more practice on Python.

Overview:

An attempt at creating a SQL-like database in python, without using any SQL-like packages

Details:

I'm going to leverage the Object Oriented features of python to make this seudo-database. The current scope is to only have the database in the memory of the local machine, but I may at some point make it so it can save files in some format (.db, .csv, etc.) to make this somewhat more practical. This project is just for my own educational purposes, but anyone interested is welcome to use what they find useful. Doubt anyone would have a use for it but hey, who knows... ;). Thanks for reading me!
